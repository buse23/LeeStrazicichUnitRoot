# LeeStrazicichUnitRoot
R code to perform the Lee Strazicich Unit Root test, which allows
the endogenous determination of one or two structural breaks.
The code is based on the original code by Junsoo Lee and Mark C. Strazicich additionally I took the available RATS code [1] by Tom Doan and replicated my results with this procedure.

I would like to thank the authors, who made the code available to me.
